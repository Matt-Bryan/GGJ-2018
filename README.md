Soul Shifter

A game where you control the soul of an old god that was trapped many years ago. You've finally recovered your strength enough to exact your revenge on humanity. Transmit your consciousness between the mortals who are attempting to prevent your rebirth, and escape the cave so you can wreak havoc on the population and begin life anew.
